## An analysis of climate induced natural disasters and its effects on various countries

### Introduction

CO2 emissions, rising global temperature, and climate-induced natural disaster rates are an oft-studied topic. In this project, we would like to analyze the trends of worldwide emissions, and the countries and industries that are the sources of these emissions. We will also explore the trends and distribution of natural disasters, and how these relate to worldwide emissions.

We will do this by exploring datasets that contain the yearly CO2 emissions by country and industry from 1995 to 2018 and the corresponding yearly counts of various natural disasters by country.

In summary, we would like to answer the following questions:

- What trends can we observe over time in Emissions by Industry and Disasters by Type?
- What are the sources of carbon emissions? Which sources correspond to higher emitters of CO2?
- Is there any correlation between the countries with high emissions and high disaster rates?

### Data Sources
For this purpose, we would like to use the following data sets:

**CO₂ Emissions, Emissions Intensities, and Emissions Multipliers**
Description: CO₂ emissions; CO₂ direct and indirect emissions per unit of output by industry and by country. CO₂ emissions by industry, in aggregate terms and in terms of output by industry for the period 1995 to 2022.

**Climate-related Disasters Frequency**
Description: Trend in the number of climate-related natural disasters for the period 1995 to 2018.

These data sources have been obtained from https://climatedata.imf.org
